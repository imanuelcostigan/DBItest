\title{DBItest: Testing 'DBI' Back Ends}
\description{
A helper that tests 'DBI' back ends for conformity
to the interface, currently work in progress.
}
\details{
The two most important functions are \code{\link[=make_context]{make_context()}} and
\code{\link[=test_all]{test_all()}}.  The former tells the package how to connect to your
DBI backend, the latter executes all tests of the test suite. More
fine-grained test functions (all with prefix \code{test_}) are available.

See the package's vignette for more details.
